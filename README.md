The *minimum viable product* for this project will be a full implementation of the *'ff'* (feature file) cursor working in tandem with `ChiDB`. From there, continuous patches will add other useful drivers for utilizing other data-base types. *Apologies* for how long that might take!
##### 2025 June update
Approaching completion of the MVP, ORM has gone from zero to hero quite easily thanks to the new `Toolips` `3.11`. The first release of `ToolipsORM`, version `0.1.0` will be ready in the coming days as I simultaneously wrap-up remaining commands and issues in `ChiDB`. So far, the build I currently have is working well as far as both are concerned. 
##### 2025 update
This repository was originally created as a mapping for my eventual plans, in **2022**. That being said -- it has yet to be developed. I needed to entertain a plethora of projects before moving onto *even the dependencies of this project.* I am close to the finish, at least -- **a finish line** as far as those projects go and as a result *soon* we will be seeing a completion of [AlgebraFrames](https://github.com/ChifiSource/AlgebraFrames.jl) and see some actual advancement on **this project.**

Kind of like how many packages have been in that past that are now done, this package is going to sit stagnant for a bit in the leadup to this but development should soon be underway.
