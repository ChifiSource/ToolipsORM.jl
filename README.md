This will eventually be an algebraic ORM (Object Relational Mapping) for toolips, which will provide an easier way to work with data-bases using a `ServerExtension`. Please keep in mind this is yet another backburner project which will have more work done to it as time goes by. I need to build an algebraic back-end for this into odd-data before I can even touch this project, so this one is certainly pretty far off -- I will get to it eventually, however. The best way to make this project come into fruition faster would actually be to help with the other lot of projects I am currently working on, more specifically... [Olive](https://github.com/ChifiSource/Olive.jl), because I really need to get this project out before I begin working on additional projects.

##### 2025 update
This repository was originally created as a mapping for my eventual plans, in **2022**. That being said -- it has yet to be developed. I needed to entertain a plethora of projects before moving onto *even the dependencies of this project.* I am close to the finish, at least -- **a finish line** as far as those projects go and as a result *soon* we will be seeing a completion of [AlgebraFrames](https://github.com/ChifiSource/AlgebraFrames.jl) and see some actual advancement on **this project.**

Kind of like how many packages have been in that past that are now done, this package is going to sit stagnant for a bit in the leadup to this but development should soon be underway.
