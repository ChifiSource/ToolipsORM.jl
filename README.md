# ToolipsORM.jl
This will eventually be an algebraic ORM (Object Relational Mapping) for toolips, which will provide an easier way to work with data-bases using a `ServerExtension`. Please keep in mind this is yet another backburner project which will have more work done to it as time goes by. I need to build an algebraic back-end for this into odd-data before I can even touch this project, so this one is certainly pretty far off -- I will get to it eventually, however. The best way to make this project come into fruition faster would actually be to help with the other lot of projects I am currently working on, more specifically... [Olive](https://github.com/ChifiSource/Olive.jl), because I really need to get this project out before I begin working on additional projects.
